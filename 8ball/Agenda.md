# Spring 2025 8-ball

# Steps
- Create a new folder named 8ball
- Build out your standard files and folders
  - index.html
  - css
    - styles.css
  - js
    - app.js
  - images
    - [images go here]
- confirm that they are linked
  - I often use an alert("hello") in my js file
  - body {background-color:green} in my css file

## Aside
1. Programming in the age of AI
    a. It's about thinking
    b. Mental effort --> learning
    c. Zone of proximal development
    d. Analogy, cheat codes in games

## Goal
1. You have been building up skils to create web pages. We will now look at the top down planning of a small application. Problem solving is a back and forth between building up capability and breaking down problems.

## Plan
1. Magic 8-Ball Process
    a. Imagine a purpose build magic 8 ball language, how would you "program it"
    b. We don't have that, let's break down what we want into the next layer down.
    c. Repeat until we get to features that exist in javascript
    d. Build ourselves back up

2. Map out our 8-Ball --> to the whiteboard

# MAPPING OUR PROGRAM
- question area
- shake() - get a fortune
  - flip 8ball - animation
  - get a fortune
    - list of fortunes
      - array
    - randomization
      - don't know but I bet it is in there
    - use randomization to pick from list
      - i bet we can figure out
  - display fortune - animation



## Discussion
1. What have we actually built? More than a magic 8 ball

## Programming Essential Questions
1. Is my code conceptually correct?
2. Is my code clear to other programmers (and my future self)?
3. Is my code easy to modify?
4. Have I addressed the needs of the users of my program?

## Competencies addressed today
